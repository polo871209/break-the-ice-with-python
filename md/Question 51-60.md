```

Result

```python
print(q54('qazh0123@gmail.com'))
gmail
```

## Question 55

> **_Write a program which accepts a sequence of words separated by whitespace as input to print the words composed of digits only._**

## Question 59

> **_Write a program to compute 1/2+2/3+3/4+...+n/n+1 with a given n input by console (n>0)._**  

---
My Solution

```python
def q59():
    n = int(input())
    total = 0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        res = i/(i+1)
        total += res
    return round(total, 2)
```

Result

```python
5
3.55
```

## Question 60

> **_Write a program to compute:_**  
```python
f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
and f(0)=0
```

--- 
My Solution

```python
def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0

print(f(n))
```

Result

```python
5
